# Isolation-Forests-in-Python
Old isolation forest code + paper + presentation I wrote for my Applied Computing class

I'll not bore you with specifics on what Isolation Forests are. For this project I wrote a paper that is stored on this repository, so if you're interested then I recommend you read that instead. If you want a short version: Isolation Forests is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that, rather than using costly distance calculations, splits the dataset into binary trees to determine outliers.
